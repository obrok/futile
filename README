= What is Futile?
Futile aims to be a cross-platform, cross-framework, robust and lightweight
functional testing package for web pages.

And yes, we _deliberately_ used those buzzwords.

= Why should I use it?
For a hypothetical users of your website the most important thing is that it
works. They don't care wether your #authorize method returns instance of user or
an integer. They don't give a damn about it! They want to see the page, type in
their login/password and see their profile. That's it. Easy as it sounds.

= Installation
 $ sudo gem install futile

= Usage
We provide you with a tool that will help you test your site from a view of
enduser. You will be able to click buttons, type fields and do thing a regular
user would do on your site.

== Show me some examples
Let's say we want to test google. We want to be sure that the search results are
ok, that the page is shown and such.

 require "rubygems"
 require "futile"

 g = Futile::Session.new("http://www.google.com")
 g.get("/")               # (1)
 g.fill("q", "google")    # (2)
 g.click_button("Search") # (3)

== What happens here?
* (1) will make sure your response was valid (not a 5xx)
* (2) takes care to check that "q"-named input exists
* (3) checks that submit field "Search" is present and sends the form
  associated with it (including your newly _typed_ values)

= JavaScript
No. This tool supports *only* html, no browser (as Firefox or Safari) is
available so you are not able to test JS.

= Authors
Futile is developed by
* Michal Bugno
* Pawel Obrok
